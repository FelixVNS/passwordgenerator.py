# passwordgenerator.py
A simple Password generator in Python, made by me, in corporation with VNS (Visual Nova Studio). Its fully customizable with your own things like the "zeichen" or something. The Password goes out in the console of your programm. I prefer Visual Studio Code, which is from Microsoft directly. When you use a created password, be sure, nobody else has it.
